# [JBA-WEB] Flashcards, baby-steps toward web development

In this simple project, I will attempt (a second time) at learning the basics of CSS & HTML systematically.  In the summer 2020, I had a previous incursion into web development through a web developer track on MDN Web Docs.  However, it was simply too heavy and I was ill-equipped both knowledge-wise and skill-wise.  I simply didn't have the foundation neccessary to solidify knowledge since I was still taking baby steps in learning about programming.  Now one year later, I am much more prepared; I have learned a few more programming languages and algorithms, thus have a more accurate mental map of the the field as a whole and web development as a sector in this field.

Now more equipped deeper knowledge and better skills, I want another run at web development this time with the help of the guided course at JetBrains Hyperskill *and* the MDN Web Docs for references.

Thus, this project starts my second run at learning web development.


## Description
In this project I will be learning about the very basics of CSS and HTML.  My goal is to create a stylized page with flashcards, eawch containing a question on one side and the answer on the other.


## Learning Outcomes
Apart from getting a useful memory-aid application, I will learn the basics of HTML and CSS.  I will gain an understanding how these two technologies can help me build a simple web page with beautiful design.
